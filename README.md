### An useful program to upload your work on PROF

[PROF] is the website where peoples studying computer science at Lille1 should upload their work.

This tool give you ability to upload your archive from the command line.

First you give your credentials

    login? calve
    pass?

In exchange, it give you the tree of all avalaible works. The boolean is whether you can upload on it or not.

    TP_ACT_Groupe1
    - 23 : TP Ordres de Grandeu (False)
    - 88 : TP Diviser pour RÃ©gn (False)
    - 103 :  TP 3 Compression Im (True)
    TP ASE Contextes
    - 45 : TP 2 (False)
    - 46 : TP 4 (False)
    TP ASE Disques
    - 47 : TP 1 (False)
    - 48 : TP 2 (True)

It ask for an id (you guessed it, the number printed in front of the work title)

    id? 95
    filename? test.tar.gz

And it is done

## CHANGELOG

 - Rewrite in Python
 - Better ui, now loop thru tp and ue list
 - Fix : Date comparaison
 - Added argument --sorted to list all TPs sorted by time. Still experimental
 - QuickFix : Clear buffer containing downloaded pages before getting TP list
 - TPs contains their UE
 - TPs contains their deadline. Maybe in a future we could sort TP by deadline
 - TPs and UEs numbers are now from 0 to n, and not the actual id on the server
 - raise exception when procedures fail
 - upload a file
 - delete a remote file
 - retrieve TP list
 - connect to the prof website, get cookie, log and retrieve an UE list

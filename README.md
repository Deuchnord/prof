Always check your file is actually send on the remote server.

## CHANGELOG

 - Rewrite in Python
 - Better ui, now loop thru tp and ue list
 - Fix : Date comparaison
 - Added argument --sorted to list all TPs sorted by time. Still experimental
 - QuickFix : Clear buffer containing downloaded pages before getting TP list
 - TPs contains their UE
 - TPs contains their deadline. Maybe in a future we could sort TP by deadline
 - TPs and UEs numbers are now from 0 to n, and not the actual id on the server
 - raise exception when procedures fail
 - upload a file
 - delete a remote file
 - retrieve TP list
 - connect to the prof website, get cookie, log and retrieve an UE list

## TODO

  - Improve ui and cli
  - Validate archive before upload
